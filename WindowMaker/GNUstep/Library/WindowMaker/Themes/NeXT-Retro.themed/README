NeXT-style "retro" theme for WindowMaker

This is the them I'm using at work. It is a mixture of styles I ran across, and it 
does not try to be "modern" in any way (I like the old look), however I do like some
eye candy, thus I added a nice background image. The background was taken from the 
wonderful "Fenris" theme found at [1].

I distribute the theme under the GNU general public license [2].
